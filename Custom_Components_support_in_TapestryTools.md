# Configuration and collect custom components #

In order to use custom components, users should set up custom components' package first, and then collect the custom components.

Users can open the custom components' configuration file by two ways:

  * 1. Select the Tapestry project, click the menu item "Edit custom component packages".

We supply an editor to edit the **.tcc Tapestry 5 custom components configuration file, once you open the**.tcc file using this editor, there are three main sections, you can edit(add & delete) the packages which include custom components. After you added all the custom components packages, click the "collect" button to collect all the custom components in this project. And then, we can edit the prefix for the custom components in each packages( Note: we support "t:" prefix for custom components only, in the future, users can use any prefix as he like).

After users collect the components, user can check the components in each package by selecting package in the left panel of this editor. All the custom components in this package will be shown in the right panel.
